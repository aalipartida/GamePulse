          <p>In Eldin Rings Newest DLC Forsaken Hollows, there will be a Scholar Class. Scholar is a support-oriented, arcane-focused "academic" class that emphasizes</p>
          <p>observation rather than raw strength. His kit blends magic and precise melee (he uses thrusting swords) along with spells making him a "spellbalde" of sorts</p>
        <p>A key ability Scholar will have is to allow him to mark enemies to debuff them. Effectively slowing them, making them an easier target, and increase damage</p>
      <p> His ultimate can link enemies together so that damage to one spreads to all, making it great for crowd control or taking on larger groups.</p></div>

          <p>The game 'Horses' was banned off of steam for a multitude of reasons and they refused to distribute the game. The developer, Santa Ragione, says that</p>
        <p>Steam told them that the game "appeared to dipict sexual conduct involving a minor" To wich the developer disagreed with. They say the came was never meant</p>
      <p>to be pronographic. They believe the problomatic content had been a scene from an earlier build involving a minor, but after revising it and changing the minor to an</p>
    <p>adult, Valve still refused the game. This ban caused much trouble for the studio. Santa Ragione says that without game sales, it threatens the studios finacial</p>
  <p>stability. Horses had resorted to looking at other storefronts to distribute the game, such as Epic Games Store, Itch.io, and Humble store. </p></div>
