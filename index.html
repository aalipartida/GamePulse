          <p>The Devs at Raven Software are rolling out significant weapon and attatchment-system changes ahead of Black Ops 7 Season 1. Attachment-building is being tightened</p>
        <p>and now weapons are limited to maximum of 5 attachments, and support for the old "Gunfire" wildcard is being removed. Meaning load-out choices matter more than ever.</p>
      <P>Athe the same time, the "Overkill" benefit is now default. So players don't need to sacrifice a wildcard slot to dual-carry. The overall philosophy driving the update is:</P>
    <p>Attachments will have a "clearer trade-offs and defined roles", so guns and builds are more purpose-driven instead of "jack-of-all-trades." This should encourage variety, experimentation,</p>
  <p>and more meaningful decisions when customizing</p></div>

          <p>According to a leak, a new Dead Rising entry, codenamed "Rec", is reportedly in development at Capcom. Productions is theorized to begin sometime in 2023</p>
        <p>The game is said to bring back protagonist Frank West and will not be set in a mall, but on a massive enclosed movie-studio lot in Hollywood. The plot is said to</p>
      <p>involve a dereanged film director trapping Frank and other survivors in the studio and forcing them to a deadly trials. All while chaos ensues due to a zombie</p>
    <p>outbreak. Fans may also get a return of classic franchise elements such as: Frank's camera for pictures, strict time-limit mechanics, and survivor-rescue system.</p>
  <p>There is no offical release date or confirmation from Capcom just yet, so it all remains a rumor for now.</p></div>

          <p>Renegades is heavily inspired by Star Wars, bringing in sci-fi "Space Western" vibes. New Weapons tupes, Outlaw-styled gameplay, and a darker underworld theme. But developers stress it</p>
        <p>remains a "Destiny story at heart." The expansion introduces a new playable mode called Lawless Frontier where players take on this risky, high-reward jobs either solo or in firearms. Players also</p>
      <p>get new gear such as energy-blaster weapons, exotic and legendary gear, and new abilities tied to the Renegade theme. Story-wise, Renegades continues the ongoing Fate Saga where players side with a shady</p>
    <p>syndicate, defy traditional authorities, and tackle a rising threat.</p></div>

          <P>The game  includes online multiplayer via Z-A battle club, a mode where up to four players face off in a real-time battle. But many matches have become frustrating</P>
        <p>as a lot of players are reportedly refusing to move or interact at all for the whole match, essentially going "AFK" (away-from-keyboard). That behavior ruins the experience</p>
      <p>for other players. Matches often fail to progress meaningfully, making online play feel broken. Beacuse this is happening often and apparently without any penalty right now, a significant</p>
    <p>portion of the community considers online mulitplayer in Z-A "Unplayable"</p></div>

          <p>Over 6,000 players of ARC Raiders have signed a petition requesting that a new usable in-game item- a handcuff- be added. The idea is that instead of killing downed players, you could</p>
        <p>cuff them. This can also add a new strategic and role-playing layers to PvP: e.g. capturing players, forcing surrender, or controlling looting/escape. As of now, handcuffs only appear in the</p>
      <p>game as "ruined" / loot-recycle items and not as usable mechanic in raids. If implemented, this mechanic could significantly change the dynamic of raids. It could allow players to disable opponets</p>
    <p>without outright killing them, potentially giving rise to new tatics, betrayals, or even "mercy"-style escapes.</p></div>
